This note is intended for guiding the setup for RaspberryPiZeroW on Mr.Robot starting from zero. 
1. Download the Pi Imager from the link below, choose the Raspberry Pi OS Legacy (Buster) lite 32 bit version and 
   the SD card, and burn it. Raspbian buster is more stable for ROS that Raspbian Bullseye. 
	https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
2. First bootup will ask for username and sudo password. Below is the initial username and password. 
	username	: pi
	pass		: raspberry
3. Changing the username and hostname
	For changing the username, follow link: 


4. connect to the internet. For this, the step-by-step guidance is from the link below.
	https://www.linuxbabe.com/command-line/ubuntu-server-16-04-wifi-wpa-supplicant
   To automatically connect to wifi when boot up, follow the step below:
	a. Create an .sh script called startup.sh in /home/(your_username)/startup.sh
	b. Fill in by the command below:
		#!/bin/bash
		sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager
		sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager
		sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
		wpa_passphrase "Krisna" ibutuden69 | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
		sudo killall wpa_supplicant
		sudo wpa_supplicant -B -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -i wlan0
		sudo dhclient wlan0
	c. make it executables by running: chmod +x /home/(your_username)/startup.sh
	d. set a crontab for it by the command: crontab -e which will edit the script using nano
	   insert the command: @reboot /home/user/startup.sh
	e. sometimes the crontab -e does not work. use sudo crontab -e and add the command @reboot as well.   
   You can find the startup.sh script in the Setup folder
   DONE!
   
4. Download git: 
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt install git-all 
   Note: github does not support email password authentication anymore. Instead it uses Personal Access Token (PAT)
   To generate one: 
        a. in the upper right corner, click your profile photo, then click settings
        b. In the left sidebar, click developer settings
        c. In the left sidebar, click Personal Access Token
        d. Click generate new token
        e. give your token a descriptive name
   NOTE: the PAT can only be seen once! so make sure you copy and save it somewhere in your local folder!
