1. Basics on using cmake:
	a. Start by creating a directory
		mkdir cmake_tutorial
	b. inside the directory, create an /src folder. This is where you store all your .cpp files. 
	   create a simple hello world program. 
	c. inside the directory again, create an /include folder. This is where you store all your header files for
	   your project
	d. inside the directory, create a file called CMakeLists.txt. This file is used to tell CMake the steps 
	   needed to make the make file to compile our cpp code. fill the CMakeLists.txt file with the minimun 
	   requirement below:
		
		cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.21)
		project(cmake_tutorials) # your project name
		set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
		set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)
		set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-O3 -Wall)
		file(GLOB CPP_SOURCE
        		"${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.cpp" # include all cpp files that are in src (1 level deep)
        		"${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*/*.cpp" # include all cpp files that are 2 level deep in src
		)
		include_directories(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
		add_executable(main ${CPP_SOURCE})

	   The explanation of each line can be seen from the CMakeLists.txt file. 

	e. type: "cmake CMakeLists.txt" in your project directory. This will create a bunch of files.
	   The most important one is the Makefile. MakeFile is the actual file that does the work for our project
	   when we run "make". 


3. Save your cmakelists.txt file 
	Finally, to save your cmake project in git, here are the files that you can put in .gitignore:
		CMakeCache.txt
		CMakeFiles/
		Makefile
		cmake_install.cmake
	since all the files above can be generated when using the command cmake CMakeLists.txt
